    <h2>What is Digtal Logic and Design</h2>
    <div class="info2">
      <p class="info3">
        Digital Logic and Design is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that focuses on the study, analysis, and design of digital circuits and systems. 
        It deals with the representation, manipulation, and processing of digital signals using logic gates and other digital components.
        Digital circuits are composed of logic gates, which are electronic devices that perform logical operations on input signals to produce an output signal based on predefined rules. 
        These logic gates are combined to form more complex circuits, enabling the implementation of various digital functions and operations.

    <h2>Prequisites</h2>
    <p class="preq1">To have a strong foundation in Digital Logic and Design, it is beneficial to have a good understanding ofFamiliarity with Boolean algebra is essential as it provides the mathematical foundation for digital logic. 
      Understanding Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT) and Boolean laws is crucial for analyzing and designing digital circuits.
      Knowledge of different number systems like binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal is necessary since digital systems operate on binary signals. 
      Understanding conversions between number systems is also important.  
      Familiarity with logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR) and their truth tables is essential. 
      Understanding the behavior and properties of these gates is fundamental to designing digital circuits.
      Ability to convert between Boolean expressions and truth tables is important. 
      Knowledge of simplifying Boolean expressions using Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps is beneficial.
