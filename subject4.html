    <h2>What is Enigineering Mathematics</h2>
    <div class="info2">
      <p class="info3">
        Engineering mathematics refers to the branch of mathematics that is specifically applied to solve engineering problems and support the analysis, design, and optimization of engineering systems. 
        It is a field of study that combines mathematical principles and techniques with engineering concepts to provide solutions for real-world engineering challenges.

    <h2>Prequisites</h2>
    <p class="preq1">A solid understanding of algebra is essential as it forms the basis for more advanced mathematical concepts. 
      Topics like equations, functions, inequalities, logarithms, and exponentials are fundamental in engineering mathematics.
      Calculus is a key component of engineering mathematics. 
      Knowledge of both differential calculus (limits, derivatives, and related rates) and integral calculus (antiderivatives, definite and indefinite integrals, applications of integration) is important. 
      It helps in understanding rates of change, optimization, and the mathematical modeling of physical phenomena.
      Linear algebra deals with vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. 
      It plays a significant role in various branches of engineering, such as electrical circuits, control systems, and structural analysis.
      Probability and statistics provide the foundation for data analysis and inference. 
      Knowledge of concepts like probability, random variables, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis is important for engineering applications involving uncertainty, reliability, and decision-making.
