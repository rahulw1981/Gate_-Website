    <h2>What is Computer Network</h2>
    <div class="info2">
      <p class="info3">Computer networks are a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, printers, switches, routers, etc.) that communicate and share resources with each other. 
        The purpose of computer networks is to enable the exchange of data, information, and resources among the connected devices, allowing them to work together and share information efficiently.

    <h2>Prequisites</h2>
    <p class="preq1">To have a strong foundation in computer networks, it is beneficial to have a good understanding of fundamental networking concepts such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), network protocols, IP addressing, subnetting, and network layers.
      Understand the basics of data communication, including concepts like data transmission, transmission media (wired and wireless), modulation, multiplexing, and error detection and correction techniques.
      Gain knowledge about the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). Understand concepts like IP addresses, domain names, URLs, DNS, HTTP, and web browsers.
      Familiarize yourself with the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the foundation of the internet. Learn about IP addressing, subnetting, routing, TCP, UDP, and common application-layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
      Have a basic understanding of network security principles, including concepts like authentication, encryption, firewalls, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and common security threats and attacks.
      Familiarity with digital logic and Boolean algebra is helpful in understanding the logical operations and circuits that underlie networking protocols and devices
